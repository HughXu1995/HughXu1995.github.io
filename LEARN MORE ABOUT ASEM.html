        <h2><b>What is ASEM?</b></h2>
        
        
        <p>
            The <b>Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)</b> is an intergovernmental process established in 1996 to foster dialogue and cooperation between Asia and Europe. Presently it comprises 53 Partners: 30 European and 21 Asian countries, the European Union and the ASEAN Secretariat. ASEM addresses political, economic, financial, social, cultural, and educational issues of common interest in a spirit of mutual respect and equal partnership.
        </p>

        <p>
            The initial ASEM Partnership in 1996 consisted of 15 EU Member States and 7 ASEAN Member States plus China, Japan, Korea and the European Commission.
        </p>    

        <p>The ASEM Summit is a biennial meeting between the Heads of State and Government, the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

        <h3>Key Characteristics of ASEM</h3>
        <p>
            As an informal process of dialogue and cooperation, based on equal partnership and enhancing mutual understanding, ASEM can best work to facilitate and stimulate progress in other fora, and should not seek to duplicate what is being done within bilateral and other multilateral relationships with Asia.
        </p>
        <p>Key characteristics of the ASEM Process include:

        <p><b>Informality</b></p>
        <p>It provides an open forum for policy makers and officials to discuss any political, economic and socio-cultural issues of common interest, complementing the work already being carried out in bilateral and other multilateral fora.</p>
        <p><b>Multi-dimensionality</b></p>
        <p>It covers the full spectrum of relations between the two regions and devotes equal weight to political, economic and socio-cultural dimensions.</p>
        <p><b>Emphasis on equal partnership</b></p>
        <p>It eschews any "aid-based" relationship taken forward under our bilateral relations in favour of a more general process of dialogue and co-operation based on mutual respect and mutual benefit.</p>
        <p><b>Dual focus on high-level and people-to-people</b></p>
        <p>It provides a platform for meetings of Heads of States and Governments, Ministers and Senior Officials, and with an increasing focus on fostering contacts between societies in all sectors in the two regions.</p>

        <h2><b>Achievements</b></h2>
        <p><b>A Dialogue Facilitator</b></p>
        <p>
            ASEM covers potentially all issues of common interest to Europe and Asia. ASEM has provided a dialogue platform to address international matters such as United Nations reforms, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) issues, terrorism, migration flows or WTO negotiations.. Asia and Europe have worked together for improving the international security environment. Overall, ASEM has become a useful process for managing globalization and its effects, for enhancing interregional and international business frameworks, and promoting the role of the Euro in Asia. ASEM is also about people and culture. It has served as a dialogue facilitator and helped increasing mutual understanding through people-to-people contacts.
        </p>
        
        <p>In that context, ASEM should be considered as a dialogue process as well as a delivery instrument. In fact, since no formal negotiations take place within ASEM, it is difficult to quantify the real contribution of ASEM on a particular issue. The delivery aspect of ASEM is not always visible since concrete developments may occur elsewhere in a more formal setting.
        </p>
        
         <p><b>A Policy-Making Laboratory</b></p>
        
        <p>ASEM is a policy-making laboratory. By promoting an open and inclusive dialogue, ASEM has allowed its participants to develop and test new ideas for future policy-making. By creating a permanent process of consultation, ASEM has helped to streamline the international agenda. As a forum promoting an open and informal dialogue, ASEM provides an opportunity to work towards negotiated solutions, especially in areas of disagreement.</p>
        
        <p>It provides additional consultation opportunities before official negotiations take place at a multilateral conference. Because ASEM remains an informal dialogue-based process, there is no formal or structured agenda. One specific institution, the <a href="http://www.asef.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF)</a>, has been created in response to Summit decisions.</p>
        
        <p>ASEM also creates opportunities for exchanging experiences and share knowledge. It facilitates some transfer of technology to Asian countries who have shown interest in the European regional integration developments. In the meantime, European partners can gain a better understanding of regional developments in Asia and the perspectives of Asia's regional integration. ASEM helps to build common knowledge on specific issues too. This feature might play a growing role in an enlarged ASEM, especially on trans-national and security issues, in particular for the fight against international terrorism.</p>
        
         <p><b>Managing Growing Europe-Asia Relations</b></p>
        <p>ASEM was established as a new process between Asia-Europe, which complements existing Europe-Asia relations. ASEM is not a substitute for other bilateral or multilateral fora between Asia and Europe, and it can best work to facilitate and stimulate progress in other for a. As a new layer of dialogue and cooperation, ASEM has enhanced synergies in Europe-Asia relations. ASEM has also served as catalyst for overall Asia-Europe relations and complements other levels of relations between the two regions.</p>
        
        <p>ASEM has helped Europe and Asia to have a more global vision of the two regions. By remaining an informal dialogue-based process, ASEM aims to promote overall Asia-Europe relations on international and inter-regional issues of common interest. By bringing together different cultures and civilisations, ASEM is a unique process to foster common understanding and dialogue</p>
